# OOPs1-Assignment
In this I have create a trait Queue which performs two functions of enqueue and dequque.
Then I had created two classes: 
-> Queue 
-> SquareQueue 
and mix in that trait.
DoubleQueue doubles the element that user will enter, SquareQueue square the element and dequeue will delete the element from the queue.
